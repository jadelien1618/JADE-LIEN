					<b>A Meditation on Noise and Signals (2023)<br><br><br></b>

					“One man’s noise is another’s information.”<br>—Terrence W. Deacon<br><br>
						
					It is rumored that the static noise on old analog TV screens may contain signals from the cosmic microwave background radiation emitted from the distant outer space. It is astounding to imagine that the code for the primordial origins of life and existence, dating back to the Big Bang, has been pervasive all around the universe in the form of a background noise that cannot be filtered out nor detected. It wasn’t until the 20th century that scientists using microwave antennas were able to discover this noise, which then immediately turned into valuable “information” to the human race.<br><br>

					The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a measure that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise. However, what actually constitutes a signal or noise is actually entirely subjective and context-dependent, lacking a universal standard or definition.<br><br>

					Interestingly, in acoustics, all frequencies are contained within the sound spectrum of white noise. Thus, theoretically, and with a slight stretch of the imagination, every song and melody you will ever hear already exists within white noise. In the recently developed Diffusion Model image generation technology, on the other hand, a series of Gaussian noise is added to an original image, turning it into a "pure noise map". The intensity of the noise is then gradually reduced in order for the program to restore and deduce the original image. Hence, A.I. has learned to recognize and extract image signals from a map of "pure noise".<br><br>

					In the current age of information, how to extract desired and relevant information and to filter out unnecessary signals from a noise field seem to have become an art form of its own. Perhaps, it is only when we learn to master this art that we may find inner peace amidst the sea of noise in this world.<br><br>
						/<br><br>
						This work includes the visual and audio component. In the single-channel video projection, a series of clear images are intentionally "noisified" and transformed into an abstract, constantly changing and elusive landscape. In the audio track, white noise is transformed into a piece of melodic and rhythmic "music" through noise reduction techniques. Through the juxtaposition between these two methods, the boundary between noise and signals are broken is reinterpreted, weaving together an immersive and meditative audio-visual experience.<br><br><br>
