						“This religion has an unknown hierarch and countless followers who have no names, no faces. It has no churches, no temples, no teachings, no donations - everything seems to be happening in a dream. However, it is spreading around the world through a group of internet divers like a pod of whales swimming in waves. Its power is immense and far-reaching, bringing huge impacts on human life. None of its followers is interested in knowing the true identity of the hierarch. All they want is to learn from its wisdom and enjoy the incredible power of faith it offers them.”<br>— Hsiung-Lin Hsiao, “The Rhapsody of Internet Religion”<br><br>
						
						This work is inspired by some quasi-mythological worldviews that are found online: Pastafarianism teaches how to balance religious influences and safeguard secular rights; Kopimism (copy-me-ism) decrees that sharing data is its supreme virtue; and Time Cube proclaims a model of reality based on the concept that one day is simultaneously four separate days. Empowered by the collective will of the online community and the snowballing effect of memes, netizens have rewritten, combined and parodied varying mythological elements to create unique emerging religious narratives.<br><br>
						
						In this work, Lien also created a fictional futuristic worldview where an unprecedented internet virus, the Digital El Nino, will lead to a global digital apocalypse. In the face of such a crisis, netizens are divided between those who believe that the rampage will free people from their addiction and reliance on the internet and those who believe that it is nothing more than a great conspiracy that will eventually destroy the entire virtual world which people can no longer live without. These perspectives then evolved into three ‘cults’, each worshiping a separate online virtual god.<br><br>
						
						With the overflowing comments on the interactive projection, resembling an online forum as well as a digital altar, the artist tried to recreate the “myth-creation/destruction” culture on the internet. Audiences can also leave real-time messages in the form of prayers to the virtual Gods, taking part in this brand-new experience of online worship.<br><br><br>
