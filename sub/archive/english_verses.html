Few will ever see you - but a true friend and a true foe have seen me.<br><br>

For we are fearful of being seen, the plain state, the blank slate of who we are, devoid of prettiness, stripped of likeness, we are little children in Sunday attires, of undecorated black and white, my vice my virtue under sun’s surgical light-beams, examined beyond dull nakedness.<br><br>

For we are hard to be seen, layered in the artistry of our daily duties, we knit our own cocoon unbrokenly, our soul takes residence to seek undisturbed sleep: a sleep eternal, till it wakes, blinking to register the gloom of death, to find none of its dreams realized, and the comprehension overdue.<br><br>

For we lose ourselves a little when seen, like a blueberry pie shared, pieces need be painfully sliced to feed the gaze of the beholders, our ruptured wholeness leaves but a few crumbs for the wounded heart, still lonely, to munch on and be comforted.<br><br><br>

One story evokes histories, one tale tells hearts<br>
One mystery resolved, more evidence be unearthed<br>
One song plucked men’s heart strings, an ensemble resounds<br>
One Love is testimony, midway in journey lovers may trust<br>
One star marks advent of destiny, its dusts soon to befall us all<br><br>
	
My little poem only swallowed my heart<br>
None its words adds weight to sink the world,<br>
nor any line bladed with intent to harm<br>
Proud sorrows are whispered, seldom delights hidden––<br>
solely like treasure they may be uncovered by you<br><br>

One receiver is key, though his name I omit to shun interpretation<br>
I will only write, entrusting the verse to multiply its own act,<br>
till abundance may prove to show all<br><br><br>

lights crowd my soul<br>
the night is with me<br><br>

chattering leaves  <br>
their topics, all, i know <br>
wind, its songs and lament <br>
charms me<br><br>
	
fill me <br><br>
	
the crossroad is home–– <br>
to dwell on many <br>
paths is a choice<br><br>

the floor is my bed<br>
onto which i fall, trusting<br>
dream will catch me with<br>
love of contentment<br><br><br>

<b>2020/3/1</b><br><br>
silence is your vengeance<br>
discreetness is your defiance<br>
my unremarkable lecture of nonsense<br>
stalled to penetrate our distance<br><br><br>

<b>2020/2/23</b><br><br>

As I pass away tonight, my interior would die and my exterior live on.<br>
I am the unison of my interiority and exteriority. I would die as I live on.<br><br>
/<br><br>

I am empty for all that is in me is outside of me<br>
What is in me oozes out of me<br><br>
	
I am the song that saunters down the road<br>
the space too vast that I may not be heard<br>
I am summer’s invisible raindrops of tears<br>
the air too damp that I may not be felt<br>
I am the eternal film imprinted on the day sky<br>
the screen too bright that I may not be seen<br>
I am the horrific visage of children’s nightmare<br>
the hour too early that I may not be remembered<br><br>
	
I reach no one yet touch them all slightly<br>
as I exhale and become one dust in the breeze of yesterday’s dusk<br><br>
	
The lock upon an abandoned graveyard gate is forever secure<br>
I will be blown in through the gaps by my own wind<br><br><br>


<b>2020/1/30</b><br><br>
two sights in one <br>
frame framed<br><br>
	
let the music decide <br>
the scene<br>
and separate <br>
what we is<br><br>
	
yet bounded <br>
within the screen <br><br>
	
the intimacy of <br>
look-aways sealed<br>
imagined relations<br><br><br>


<b>2019/12/16</b><br><br>

dough of one thought<br>
with lyrics whisked <br>
in slow motion<br>
rained snow away<br>
ran walkers into shops<br>
hid I behind windows <br>
Shopped, and I displayed<br>
before the frame<br>
where things happen<br>
or images flirt<br>
beyond the setting<br><br><br>
<b>2019/11/24</b><br><br>
Who is the one with substance? Who is the one with soul? A moment ago in the hallway you slipped through me and I slipped through you. With the extending distance between two who refuse to turn their heads, a space is made for us to wonder as we wander on. Whose image would the security camera seize under scrutiny? Who holds the key to the room ahead? Which is apparition? Who is ghost?<br><br>

One time on the train, I looked out the window at the cityscape all blurred by motion except your face, whose eyes faithfully follow me with a vision ceaseless and immobile. Another time on the street, a familiar silhouette is captured in the photograph you took for her. But as you raised your head to trace its origin, the empty street is the only answer which awaits you and at its end, one gate, ajar.<br><br><br>
<b>2019/11/1</b><br><br>
Lies the meshes of dusk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the people<br><br>

Yarns the ribbons of <br>
premature moon-rays<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over lovers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	to the young man<br><br><br>

<b>2019/10/26</b><br><br>
Leaves of October in ecstasy flutter, <br>
drugged with life, as a cracker, <br>
pulled by invisible winds,<br>
bursts lotteries or flames <br><br>

Yet in mid-air they quiver<br>
from sudden agitation<br>
and come to the ground promptly aware of <br>
its repose, and motion stilled<br><br><br>


<b>2019/10/23</b><br><br>
Stumbled upon each other, two<br>
on the streets, tripped over<br>
a beat of heart, skipped,<br>
and dropped, <br>
a Roman, no two, <br>
among a pool of items <br>
to the ground, scattered,<br>
some matters of unanticipated significance<br><br>

Such sudden notice apprehended <br>
by that impartial eye––in cinema <br>
transpire not instantaneously <br>
but twice so:<br>
either he glances first at her <br>
or she be glanced<br>
followed by which <br>
she glances at him or he<br>
be glanced<br>
Unlike in these honest lines,<br>
a look is a look returned<br>
and in their duration, <br>
the sum of a story told<br><br><br>

<b>2019/9/29</b><br><br>
No longer is that single lampshade crowned with aura<br>
as light radiates through the windows and some thousand eyes<br>
The city gleams in arrogance of its civilization and<br>
––compensated through the receding of Day<br>
maintains an equilibrium of luminance<br>
so that guardian of ours named not Night<br>
but Heaven may dream on undisturbed<br><br>

Yet the Empyrean aroused with a start and<br>
immediate exhaustion<br>
when in twinkling morse codes the naughty stars chatter<br>
Through some vague notions of previous hours<br>
formed through habits of memories or perhaps reveries<br>
it scowls though with kindness<br>
at the same landscapes to overlook a day further<br>
the same discourses to hearken to<br>
the same faces to disremember<br>
all millions of them but one<br><br><br>

<b>2019/9/18</b><br><br>

a thread of lies <br>
each word a pearl <br>
extricated from an infected oyster <br>
by the hands of a woman<br><br>

the necklace you keep as a token <br>
that can be taken out occasionally <br>
to shame me with its <br>
purity sincere of fakeness<br><br><br><br>
